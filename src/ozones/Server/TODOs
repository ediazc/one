The following files are replicated and improved from Sunstone:
sunstone.js
sunstone-util.js
layout.css

They should be copied back to sunstone folder as these are improved versions valid for both ozones and sunstone, so they should not break Sunstone.

JSONUtils.rb is mostly a replica from the Sunstone version (unwrapped from module OpenNebulaJSON) .
